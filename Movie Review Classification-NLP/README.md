## Movie Review Sentiment Analysis using NLP and Machine Learning

This project goal is to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and 
various machine learning algorithms.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the IMDb movie review dataset, which consists of 50,000 movie reviews labeled as either positive or negative.

### Preprocessing
The movie reviews are preprocessed using various NLP techniques, such as tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming. The preprocessed data is then vectorized 
using the Count Vectorizer to convert text data into numerical features.

### Machine Learning Algorithms
The following machine learning algorithms are used to train and evaluate the movie review sentiment classification model:

- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Multinomial Naive Bayes (NB)

### Evaluation Metrics
The accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the classification model.

### Results
The models were trained on a dataset of more than 1000 movie reviews. The results of the evaluation are as follows:

Random forest: 83% accuracy

KNN: 65% accuracy

Multinomial NB: 85% accuracy

### Conclusion
The project demonstrates how to implement a movie review positive or negative NLP project using random forest, KNN, and multinomial NB. The models were able to achieve high accuracy on the test dataset.
