#  News Category Classification NLP project 

## Project Description:

This project aims to classify news articles into different categories using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and the Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) algorithm. The dataset used for this project is the AG News Corpus, which consists of news articles from four categories: World, Sports, Business, and Science/Technology.

The project involves the following steps:

## Data Preprocessing: 
The raw text data is preprocessed to remove stop words, punctuation. The text data is then tokenized, lemmatized.

## Feature Extraction:
 The preprocessed text data is transformed into numerical feature vectors using the Bag-of-Words model. This model represents each document as a vector of word frequencies.

## Model Training: 
The Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) algorithm is trained on the feature vectors to create a classifier that can predict the category of a news article based on its text content.

## Model Evaluation: 
The accuracy of the MNB classifier is evaluated using classification report and performance metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score 

## Results
The model was trained on a dataset of news articles. The results of the evaluation are as follows:

Accuracy: 86%

Precision: 92%

Recall: 92%

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates how to implement a news category classification NLP project using multinomial NB.
The model was able to achieve high accuracy on the test dataset after preprocessing.
